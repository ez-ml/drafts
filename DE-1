Proposal to Introduce the Tools Registry Feature
The absence of a centralized Tools Registry is exposing the platform to several operational and security risks. Without a controlled mechanism to register and validate tools, issues such as unauthorized tool usage, lack of version management, and inconsistent functionality arise. This leads to potential misuse, security vulnerabilities, and operational inefficiencies. In the current state, tools can be invoked without proper oversight, making it difficult to govern tool usage, prevent resource abuse, and ensure compliance with business logic.

We propose implementing a Tools Registry to manage tool metadata, allowed functions, and version control centrally. This registry will enforce signature validation, ensuring that only authorized tool functions are invoked with the correct parameters, thus mitigating risks like invalid inputs and unauthorized tool behaviors. However, it's important to note that while signature validation can prevent incorrect function usage, it does not address the full validation of business logic, and deeper controls like resource management and security audits will be required.

Two-Phased Approach
1. Short-Term Approach (Manual Yaml-Based Registry): In the short term, we propose maintaining tool metadata in a YAML file that will be managed by the Platform Team. This file will define the tool signatures, including function names, allowed parameters, types, and expected outputs. Each time a tool is added or updated, the Platform Team will validate and update the YAML file, ensuring proper oversight.

This approach offers a quick solution to gain immediate control over tool invocations without major infrastructural changes. It allows us to introduce governance and validation in a simplified manner while giving the team time to plan for a more scalable, automated solution.

2. Long-Term Approach (Self-Service Registry with DynamoDB and API): For long-term scalability and self-service capability, we propose building a more robust, self-service-based Tools Registry. This approach will involve using DynamoDB as the backend to store tool metadata and version information, fronted by a RESTful API built with FastAPI. This API will allow authorized users to register, update, and query tool information programmatically, enabling flexibility and removing the dependency on the Platform Team for manual updates.

This self-service model provides better scalability and empowers teams to manage their own tools while maintaining central control. The API will enforce validation rules, such as signature matching, and the backend will provide built-in scalability and resilience via DynamoDB.

While the first approach allows for quick adoption and governance, the second approach paves the way for a fully automated, scalable system that can handle future growth and increasing tool complexity across teams.

Overview
The LLM Agent is designed to handle complex workflows in three phases:

Plan: Parse the input plan (String, DAG, AST).
Schedule: Manage task dependencies and prepare execution.
Execute: Execute the tasks using a task executor.
The architecture allows for flexible task management using in-memory queues, with support for Redis/Celery in future updates.

Architecture Design
The system is broken down into the following components:

GraphBuilder: Builds the task graph from a YAML configuration.
PlanParser: Parses the plan input (String, DAG, AST) using appropriate parsers.
TaskGenerator: Converts the parsed plan into tasks.
TaskExecutor: Manages task execution with support for different queue implementations.
LLMAgent: Coordinates the flow from plan parsing to task execution.

-------


1. Overview
a. Problem Statement
Dynamic Task Execution presents challenges when dealing with workflows that involve varying task dependencies, adaptive planning, and context-sensitive decisions. Traditional approaches to task management rely on pre-defined static rules, which lack the flexibility required to adapt to evolving conditions in real time. In particular, there is a need for systems that can parse natural language input, generate dynamic task plans, handle execution, and adapt workflows to changing requirements.

b. Motivation
The demand for automated task execution solutions has increased across multiple teams. Tenant teams often require an intelligent task management system that can:

Parse various input formats (textual descriptions, data graphs, etc.).
Handle tasks with interdependencies and complex execution flows.
Integrate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities for enhanced decision-making.
Scale effectively for high-volume task execution scenarios.
To address these needs, we propose the development of a modular, extensible LLM-based Dynamic Executor Agent, which leverages LangGraph for task orchestration and integrates state-of-the-art RAG techniques.

c. Requirements
The proposed system must meet the following requirements:

Task Parsing and Execution

Support multiple input types, including strings, Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
Generate tasks with defined dependencies based on parsed plans.
Dynamic Routing and Replanning

Provide adaptive routing based on real-time task outcomes.
Enable replanning for workflows where task priorities change dynamically.
Scalability

Support execution of high-concurrency tasks using distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Redis, Celery).
Scale horizontally to accommodate more tenant teams and diverse workflows.
Modular and Extensible Architecture

Implement a flexible architecture that allows replacing different components (parsers, executors, etc.) without significant changes.
Integrate seamlessly with LLMs and RAG workflows.
d. Proposal
The Dynamic Executor Agent will be designed to execute tasks dynamically using a three-component system: Plan Parser, Task Generator, and Task Scheduler/Executor. These components will work together to parse input plans, generate tasks with dependencies, and execute them in a scalable, adaptable manner. The proposed agent will use LangGraph to represent workflows, enabling adaptive decision-making and dynamic task orchestration.

2. Design and Architecture
a. Overview of Dynamic Executor Agent
The Dynamic Executor Agent architecture comprises three main components that facilitate dynamic task execution:

Plan Parser: Converts input plans from different formats (e.g., text, DAG, AST) into a standard representation, typically as a graph.
Task Generator: Reads the parsed plan and generates tasks, setting up dependencies between them.
Task Scheduler and Executor: Manages task execution according to the dependencies and current system state. Supports retry mechanisms, error handling, and monitoring.
b. Core Components
1. Plan Parser
Functionality: Parses different types of plans and converts them into a representation that can be used to generate tasks. It uses an adapter pattern to support various parsing strategies.
Design Considerations: Modular design to support future addition of new parsers. For example, a decorator-based approach can be used to swap between a textual parser and a DAG parser without altering the core logic.
2. Task Generator
Functionality: Converts the parsed plan into discrete tasks with dependencies. It uses classes for task types (e.g., LLM tool tasks, API tasks) and maintains the relationships between them.
Design Considerations: The generator needs to account for various dependency resolution strategies, especially in complex workflows where tasks may have multiple prerequisites.
3. Task Scheduler and Executor
Functionality: Responsible for scheduling and executing tasks based on their dependencies. It integrates monitoring and error handling features to manage task retries and handle execution failures.
Execution Strategies: Supports both in-memory execution for rapid tasks and distributed execution using frameworks like Celery for long-running processes.
c. Interaction Diagrams (Lucid Chart Style)
i. Sequence Diagram
Demonstrates the flow from plan parsing through task generation to execution, including conditional replanning based on task outcomes.
ii. Class Diagram
Shows relationships between classes such as PlanParser, TaskGenerator, TaskScheduler, LLMAdapter, etc.
iii. Component Diagram

Part 2: Implementation
3. Implementation
a. Detailed Code Structures
The implementation of the Dynamic Executor Agent follows a modular architecture where each component can be developed and extended independently. The primary components include:

1. Plan Parsing Module
Architecture: Uses an adapter-based approach, where different parsers can be plugged in depending on the input format (e.g., text-based, DAG, or AST). Each parser converts the input into a structured representation like a graph, where nodes represent tasks and edges represent dependencies.
Example Code Snippet:
python
Copy code
class PlanParser:
    def parse(self, input_plan: str) -> TaskGraph:
        # Implementation depends on the input type
        if isinstance(input_plan, str):
            return self.parse_text(input_plan)
        elif isinstance(input_plan, dict):
            return self.parse_dag(input_plan)
        elif isinstance(input_plan, AST):
            return self.parse_ast(input_plan)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported plan format")
2. Task Generation Module
Architecture: Takes the parsed graph and generates individual task objects with dependencies. Uses abstract base classes for different task types (e.g., LLM-based tasks, API calls, function invocations).
Dependency Handling: Utilizes topological sorting to ensure tasks are executed in the correct order based on their dependencies.
Example Code Snippet:
python
Copy code
class TaskGenerator:
    def generate_tasks(self, task_graph: TaskGraph) -> List[Task]:
        sorted_nodes = topological_sort(task_graph)
        tasks = [self.create_task(node) for node in sorted_nodes]
        return tasks

    def create_task(self, node: TaskNode) -> Task:
        # Task creation logic based on node attributes
        if node.type == "LLMTask":
            return LLMTask(node)
        elif node.type == "APICall":
            return APITask(node)
        else:
            return GenericTask(node)
3. Task Scheduler and Executor
Architecture: Implements scheduling strategies to execute tasks, supporting both parallel and sequential execution based on task dependencies. For distributed execution, it integrates with systems like Celery.
Error Handling: Includes retry mechanisms and fallback plans for tasks that fail during execution.
Execution Example:
python
Copy code
class TaskExecutor:
    def execute(self, tasks: List[Task]):
        for task in tasks:
            if self.all_dependencies_satisfied(task):
                self.run_task(task)

    def run_task(self, task: Task):
        try:
            result = task.execute()
            task.set_result(result)
        except Exception as e:
            task.retry_or_fallback(e)
b. Algorithms and Logic
1. Topological Sorting for Dependency Resolution
Algorithm: Ensures tasks are executed in the correct order by arranging tasks based on their dependencies.
Complexity: Uses depth-first search (DFS) with a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of tasks and E is the number of dependencies.
2. Error Handling Strategies
Retry Mechanism: Implements exponential backoff for retrying tasks that fail due to transient issues.
Fallback Mechanisms: Allows manual interventions or alternative strategies when automatic retries fail.
c. Integration Points for RAG and LangGraph
1. Incorporating RAG Techniques
Description: Retrieval-Augmented Generation is used to supplement the LLM-based tasks with relevant information retrieved from databases, knowledge bases, or search engines. The agent fetches data during execution to improve decision-making.
Benefits: Enhances the accuracy and reliability of LLM outputs by grounding them in real-world data.
2. Using LangGraph for Workflow Management
Description: LangGraph allows modeling workflows as state machines, making it suitable for representing task dependencies, execution states, and conditional flows.
Use Cases:
Self-Reflective RAG: Implements flows where the agent evaluates the quality of retrieved documents and decides whether to re-run queries or move forward​(
LangChain Blog
).
Corrective RAG: Uses feedback loops to refine retrieval and task generation processes.
