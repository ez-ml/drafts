Month 1: Automation Gaps & Permission Analysis
1.1 Automation Gaps
Namespace Creation & ArgoCD Sync:

Gap: Manual intervention required for namespace creation and syncing with ArgoCD.

Solution: Automate namespace creation using Terraform and integrate ArgoCD with CI/CD pipelines for automated syncing.

Timeline: Week 1-4.

Lockbox & System Account Integration:

Gap: Manual intervention needed for integrating Lockbox and system accounts.

Solution: Develop scripts to automate Lockbox and system account integration using APIs.

Timeline: Week 5-8.

1.2 Permission Gaps
Four-Dimensional Metrics:

Dimensions:

Role: CSO vs. Platform Team roles.

Task: Specific tasks requiring permissions (e.g., namespace creation).

Resource: Access to specific resources (e.g., Kubernetes clusters).

Action: Types of actions allowed (e.g., read, write).

Comparison: Map CSO vs. Platform Team permissions against these dimensions.

Timeline: Week 1-4.

Permission Mapping:

Task-Based Permissions: Align permissions with tasks identified in the metrics.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement RBAC to enforce task-based permissions.

Timeline: Week 5-8.

Month 2: Observability & Training Materials
2.1 Observability
OTEL, Splunk, Eval Logging:

Gap: Limited observability into system performance and model-related metrics.

Solution: Implement OpenTelemetry (OTEL) for distributed tracing, integrate Splunk for log analysis, and enhance Eval Logging for model performance metrics.

Timeline: Week 9-12.

Model-Related Observability:

Gap: Lack of visibility into model performance and inference metrics.

Solution: Develop dashboards to monitor model accuracy, latency, and throughput using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

Timeline: Week 13-16.

2.2 Interactive Training Materials
Web Interface Development:

Gap: Current documentation is static and not engaging.

Solution: Design an interactive web interface using tools like React or Vue.js to present training materials in an engaging format.

Timeline: Week 9-12.

Features: Include quizzes, simulations, and gamification elements.

Content Creation:

Gap: Lack of comprehensive training content.

Solution: Develop comprehensive guides and tutorials on observability tools, automation scripts, and permission management.

Timeline: Week 13-16.

Month 3: OKRs for Platform Team & Finalization
3.1 OKRs for Platform Team
Objective Setting:

Objectives:

Automate 80% of namespace creation and ArgoCD syncing processes.

Reduce permission discrepancies by 50%.

Achieve 90% observability coverage for system and model metrics.

Develop and deploy interactive training materials to 100% of the team.

Key Results: Track progress through metrics like automation success rate, permission gap closure, observability dashboard adoption, and training material engagement.

Timeline: Week 17-20.

OKR Review & Adjustment:

Gap: OKRs may need adjustments based on progress.

Solution: Conduct regular reviews to adjust OKRs as necessary.

Timeline: Ongoing throughout the quarter.

3.2 Finalization & Review
Automation & Permission Review:

Gap: Ensure all automation gaps are closed and permissions are aligned.

Solution: Conduct thorough reviews of automation scripts and permission mappings.

Timeline: Week 21-24.

Observability & Training Review:

Gap: Verify observability tools are fully implemented and training materials are effective.

Solution: Evaluate observability dashboard adoption and gather feedback on training materials.

Timeline: Week 21-24.
