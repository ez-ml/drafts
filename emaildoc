Hi Shailesh!

I got this response back this morning: "My apologies for the confusion. We reached out to Fragomen and they let us know that porting an AOS to Capital One usually only starts after the candidate onboards with Capital One. With that said, the candidate can set a start date and join on their GC EAD, and then reach out to our team once onboarded to initiate the process."

So it sounds like once you set a start date, you can put in two weeks and then once you start, that's when they'll initiate the transfer. Sorry for the confusion!

Best,
Chris

Hi Chris, 
Sorry for the confusion, but it looks like I have already completed the post offer questionnaire and haven't mentioned sponsorship in it as GC/EAD status would not fall under Spincership requirement . 



Thanks & Regards,

Hi Chris, 
I havent started on a post offer questionnaire and there is no task assigned to me in the portal, but the answer to the question "If you need sponsorship" should be "No" . The EAD transfer is not a sponsorship . 

Let me know if you like more details !

Hi Shailesh! Quick question for you: in the post offer questionnaire, did you mention you will need sponsorship? It sounds like that is when you will enter our HLT Immigration required list and we will initiate their transfer with our Immigration counsel, Fragomen.

I spoke to one of my colleagues and it sounds like we should be good to go since it's GC-EAD, but let's submit the form just to be safe and cross any other bridges if we need to!
