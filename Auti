Proposal: FastLane Onboarding Automation
The FastLane Onboarding Automation is designed to eliminate repetitive and error-prone manual steps currently involved in onboarding new tenants to our LLM & RAG Platform.

üéØ Goals:
Minimize tenant manual effort

Accelerate tenant onboarding

Automate error-prone manual tasks

Provide clear visibility and intuitive experience

‚úÖ Current vs. Improved Process Mapping:
Current Manual Step	New Automated Step (with intuitive names)	Responsibility
1. Pipeline Component Creation
(Manual, but acceptable)	Pipeline QuickStart
Manual, no immediate automation required	Platform Team
2. K8 Namespace Creation
(In progress by SRE team)	AutoNamespace Provisioner
Automated Kubernetes Namespace creation with self-service UI and API	SRE Team (with collaboration)
3. Tenant RBAC & Secret Management
(Manual system account & grant creation, HashiCorp ‚Üí AWS Secrets Manager migration)	SecureAccess AutoRBAC
Automated RBAC provisioning & AWS Secret Manager Integration, replacing manual steps with template-driven workflows	Platform Team (with minimal tenant input)
4. Git Repo Creation
(Bot setup and manual onboarding)	GitAutoPilot
Fully automated repo creation and bot onboarding in tenant's Git organization	Platform Team (automated bot onboarding)
5. FM Gateway Setup
(Manual assessment and onboarding)	FastRoute Gateway
Automated FM Gateway provisioning, pre-integrated validation, and auto-assessment reporting	Platform Team
üîÑ Detailed Automation Steps
1. Pipeline QuickStart (Minimal Effort)
Keep this manual (already minimal overhead).

Future scope: Review semi-automation (templates & self-service portal).

2. AutoNamespace Provisioner
SRE team to deliver automated Kubernetes namespace provisioning:

Self-Service Portal: Tenants request namespaces via UI/API.

Auto-Provisioning: Namespace created instantly via automation scripts.

Visibility: Status and logs provided back immediately.

Benefit: Eliminates SRE bottlenecks, reduces delays.

3. SecureAccess AutoRBAC
Shift from HashiCorp Lockbox to AWS Secrets Manager:

Template-driven Roles: Predefined AWS IAM and Kubernetes roles auto-generated.

System Account Automation: Auto-creation of Kubernetes system account linked to IAM roles.

Integrated AWS Secrets Manager: Secure and simplified integration via pre-defined policies.

Tenant Interaction: Minimal, intuitive web-based selection.

Benefit: Removes extensive manual tenant tasks, reduces onboarding errors significantly.

4. GitAutoPilot
Automated Git repo creation and bot onboarding:

Auto-provision repo in tenant's GitHub/GitLab org.

Bot Onboarding: Automatic addition of CI/CD bot accounts, credentials, and webhook setup.

Tenant Interaction: Single-click authorization.

Benefit: Removes manual tenant intervention, immediate readiness for deployment pipelines.

5. FastRoute Gateway
Automated provisioning & validation for FM Gateway:

Auto-provision Gateway resources based on tenant selections.

Real-time assessment and reporting of time savings compared to legacy process.

Tenant Interaction: One-click enablement via intuitive UI.

Benefit: Immediate utilization of optimized FM Gateway, substantial onboarding time reduction.

üöÄ Tenant Onboarding Flow (Future State)
New Simplified Workflow:

Tenant accesses the FastLane Onboarding UI.

Tenant initiates onboarding by entering basic information.

AutoNamespace Provisioner automatically creates Kubernetes namespace.

SecureAccess AutoRBAC automatically provisions IAM roles, system accounts, and AWS Secrets Manager integration.

GitAutoPilot creates and configures Git repos and onboard CI/CD bots automatically.

Tenant selects FastRoute Gateway, automated provisioning and validation occur immediately.

Tenant proceeds with minimal manual pipeline configuration (Pipeline QuickStart).

Real-time visibility and automatic error handling through onboarding dashboard.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools
Component	Recommended Technology
AutoNamespace Provisioner	Terraform / Kubernetes Operator, ArgoCD
SecureAccess AutoRBAC	AWS IAM, Kubernetes OIDC, AWS Secrets Manager
GitAutoPilot	GitHub API, GitLab API, Bot Frameworks (GitHub Apps, GitLab Apps)
FastRoute Gateway	AWS API Gateway or Internal Gateway tooling
Onboarding UI Portal	ReactJS / NextJS, NodeJS backend (or similar)
üìå Benefits Achieved
Dramatic Reduction in Tenant Effort: From multiple complex manual steps to intuitive, mostly automated clicks.

Enhanced Speed: Onboarding time significantly reduced, comparable to Amazon Bedrock or SaaS-based solutions.

Increased Reliability: Reduced human error through automated validations and standardization.

Improved Visibility: Transparent onboarding with real-time status, feedback, and reporting dashboards.

üéñÔ∏è Next Steps
Initiate collaboration sessions with SRE for AutoNamespace Provisioner automation.

Begin migration planning from HashiCorp Lockbox to AWS Secrets Manager.

Prototype UI/UX design for intuitive onboarding portal.

Pilot GitAutoPilot and SecureAccess AutoRBAC with select tenants.

Validate benefits of FastRoute Gateway against the current FM gateway process.
