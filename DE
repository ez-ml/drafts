Technical Design Document (TDD) for Dynamic Executor - Plan and Execute Style Agent
1. Problem Statement
The demand for Plan and Execute style agents has grown substantially as organizations and teams seek to automate and streamline complex workflows. Plan and Execute agents are capable of taking high-level objectives or plans and breaking them down into actionable steps, allowing for dynamic and efficient execution. These agents leverage planning, reasoning, and task execution to enhance their ability to solve problems without requiring constant human intervention.

The LangChain framework demonstrates how Planning and Execution agents can be valuable in a range of scenarios. By integrating these agents into an organization's system, it enables tasks such as conditional planning, multi-tool execution, and complex decision-making workflows.

From your team’s perspective, having such an offering would immensely boost tenant teams' timelines by automating task execution and providing a robust solution for managing multi-stage processes. Currently, there is no such offering within the GenAI Platform, leaving tenant teams without a reliable solution to streamline workflows.

In addition to the core benefits, there is a need to foster a collaborative model where tenant teams can contribute directly to the platform, building and customizing their workflows based on their unique requirements. Introducing a Plan and Execute agent framework would be a key addition to the GenAI Platform, enhancing productivity and reducing the need for custom-built solutions.

2) Requirements
3. Proposal
We are building a framework capability that will enable the creation of Plan and Execute style agents. This architecture will allow the dynamic execution of tasks based on input plans, using both sequential and parallel task handling, as outlined in the attached diagram. By leveraging frameworks like LangChain and our internal GenAI components, we will enable the seamless integration of these agents into existing workflows.

Proposal Outline:
Input Plan Schemas: The system will accept plans in different formats (e.g., Python code, conditional graphs), as demonstrated in the diagram.
Plan Parsing: The framework will include a Python AST Parser and DAG Parser to convert input plans into iterable data structures like AST and DAG.
Task Producers: Based on the parsed plans, the system will produce tasks and organize them for execution in a structured manner. These tasks will either be sequential or parallel, managed by components such as the AST Task Producer and DAG Task Producer.
Task Execution and Management: The tasks will then be queued and executed by the Task Executor, which will manage the task states and ensure successful completion or retries as needed. The state of each task will be updated in the State Object to reflect the real-time execution progress.
By enabling this Plan and Execute Agent Architecture, we can empower tenant teams to collaborate, contribute, and create their custom workflows. This offering fits into the broader framework of component-based architecture within the GenAI Platform, allowing teams to leverage existing tools and retrievers while customizing their workflows.

Technical Design Document (TDD) for Dynamic Executor Agent Using LangChain Runnable Components with Workflow Framework Tools (Without LLMCompiler)

1. Overview
The Dynamic Executor Agent is designed to process input plans that are provided as Python code, conditional graphs, or other formats. These plans are parsed, and tasks are dynamically generated and executed using parallel and sequential workflows based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) derived from an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
The agent integrates Workflow Framework Components, including Tools (external APIs) and Retrievers (data-fetching components), to execute tasks. LangChain Runnable Components are used for modular and scalable task execution. The system ensures efficient execution of tasks, handles task dependencies, and supports parallel execution.

2. Problem Statement
Existing task execution systems face several challenges:
Tight coupling to specific libraries reduces flexibility.
Inefficient handling of dynamically generated tasks.
Lack of robust mechanisms for parallel and sequential task execution.
The Dynamic Executor Agent addresses these limitations by:
Providing a flexible, modular architecture.
Supporting integration with Workflow Framework Components such as external tools and retrievers.
Enabling real-time updates and control with parallel and sequential workflows.
Leveraging LangChain Runnable Components for task execution.

3. Architecture Overview
The Agent-based Task Execution System is built using LangChain Runnables and is designed to handle complex workflows involving multiple tasks. The system has three primary components: Plan Parser, Task Producer, and Task Executor. The Plan Parser processes input plans of various formats like strings and conditional graphs, the Task Producer generates executable tasks based on the parsed input, and the Task Executor is responsible for the parallel or sequential execution of these tasks.
This document details the architecture, components, and functional flow of the system, while leveraging key elements from LangChain's LLMCompiler for increasing parallel task execution efficiency. Additionally, the system is integrated with DynamoDB and Redis to manage task states, handle stale tasks, and process task outputs efficiently.

The architecture consists of the following key components:


Key Components:
Plan Parser:
Input Plan: Can be of various types, such as a string plan or a conditional graph.
Tools: External APIs or custom tools that will be used during task execution.
Retriever: Data fetching components that provide the necessary inputs for task execution.
Parsers: The system supports multiple parsers, including AST Parser and DAG Parser, inherited from a generic Plan Parser class.
Task Producer:
Input: Takes an AST or DAG from the Plan Parser.
Task Generation: Generates tasks to be executed either sequentially or in parallel.
Task Producer Variants: Includes AST Task Producer and DAG Task Producer to accommodate different input types.
LLMCompiler Recommendation: We recommend using LLMCompiler for efficient task management and optimization for specific workflows but not mandatory.
Task Executor:
Task Execution: Executes tasks in parallel or sequence, depending on task dependencies.
Parallelism: Follows the design from the LLMCompiler to optimize parallel task execution.
State Management: Task results and outputs are stored and tracked via DynamoDB and Redis queues.
Robustness: Implements stale task management and retries for failed tasks.
Scenario:
We will demonstrate the system by executing 20 tasks, some in parallel and some in sequence, using both AST and DAG task structures.
1. AST Flow Example (Sequential Execution):
Input Plan: (Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3 → Task 4 → Task 5)
Plan Parser: Parses this plan as an AST where the tasks must be executed sequentially.
Task Producer: Converts the AST into a series of dependent tasks.
Task Executor: Executes Task 1, waits for its completion, then moves to Task 2, and so on until all tasks are executed.

2. DAG Flow Example (Parallel and Sequential Execution):
Input Plan:
Task 1 and Task 2 are independent and can run in parallel.
Task 3 depends on Task 2, while Task 4 depends on both Task 1 and Task 3.
Task 5 is dependent on Task 4.
Plan Parser: Parses this plan as a DAG where certain tasks are independent and can be executed in parallel.
Task Producer: Converts the DAG into a series of dependent and independent tasks.
Task Executor: Executes Task 1 and Task 2 in parallel. Once they complete, Task 3 and Task 4 are executed, followed by Task 5.

            ↓
         Task 5

c) Technical Architecture
The technical architecture defines how each component interacts with one another, leveraging DynamoDB for state management, Redis for queue handling, and LangChain Runnable Components for modularity and scalability.
1. Plan Parser Module:
Input Plan Schema: Defines the structure for all accepted plan types (string plans, conditional graphs).
Parser Inheritance: The generic Plan Parser class supports multiple parser types:
AST Parser: Handles task plans represented as Abstract Syntax Trees.
DAG Parser: Handles task plans represented as Directed Acyclic Graphs.
Integration with Tools and Retrievers: The parser receives a list of tools and retrievers that are authorized to be used in task execution.
2. Task Producer Module:
Input: Accepts either AST or DAG as the parsed input.
Producer Variants:
AST Task Producer: Breaks down the AST into individual tasks for sequential execution.
DAG Task Producer: Analyzes the DAG and generates tasks with dependencies for parallel and sequential execution.
Task Generation: Tasks are generated based on the input structure and pushed to the Task Executor for execution.
Reference to LLMCompiler: While we propose a generic task production system, LLMCompiler can be leveraged to optimize and enhance certain task executions, particularly in workflows involving language models.
3. Task Executor Module:
Task Execution: Executes tasks in parallel or sequence as dictated by the Task Producer.
State Management: Uses DynamoDB to store task states and outputs. For example:
Task initiation, completion, retries, or failures are recorded.
Queue Management: Uses Redis to queue tasks for execution, handle retries, and manage stale tasks.
Parallelism: Follows best practices for parallel task execution as outlined in the LLMCompiler architecture, ensuring tasks are executed efficiently with minimal latency.
Error Handling and Retries: Built-in retry logic for handling failed tasks.

Fetching Unit Design and Integration with Task Producer and Task Executor
The Fetching Unit in the Task Execution System is responsible for retrieving the input data required for each task. It interacts with the Task Producer and Task Executor to ensure that all necessary data is available before a task is executed. This unit will leverage Retrievers (such as database retrievers, API retrievers, etc.) to fetch the data based on the tools and task specifications.
Here’s how the Fetching Unit works, its design, and an example of its input/output interaction with the Task Producer and Task Executor.

Fetching Unit Design
1. Overview
The Fetching Unit is responsible for:
Data Retrieval: Fetching the necessary data for each task before execution. This can involve:
API calls to retrieve data from external services.
Database queries to get records from a database.
File or cloud storage retrieval to access files, configuration data, or models.
Tool Integration: Fetching data based on the tools and retrievers specified in the plan.
Caching and Pre-fetching: Caching results to avoid redundant data fetching and potentially pre-fetching data if a task requires it.
2. Fetching Unit Flow
Task Producer generates a task.
Fetching Unit checks the retrievers specified in the task (e.g., API retriever, database retriever).
Data is fetched from the specified sources.
The fetched data is passed to the Task Executor for execution.
3. Fetching Unit Components
Retriever Interface: A unified interface that handles different types of data fetchers (API, database, file, etc.).
Data Caching: Stores fetched data temporarily to avoid redundant calls, especially when multiple tasks depend on the same data.
Pre-fetching Logic: Optionally pre-fetches data based on future task needs, reducing latency.

4. Retrievers and Tools
Each task in the Task Producer has specific retrievers and tools associated with it. The Fetching Unit will:
Inspect the task: Determine what data is needed.
Use retrievers: Fetch the data via API calls, database queries, or other services.
Pass data: Once the data is fetched, it is passed to the Task Executor to execute the task.

Input/Output Interaction Between Components

      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
  }
}


Detailed Example Flow (Using AST)
Let's go through a complete flow where tasks are fetched and executed using an AST plan:
Input Plan (AST) is Parsed:
The Plan Parser processes an AST plan that defines tasks like fetching user data, validating an order, and sending an email.
Task Producer Generates Tasks:
The Task Producer reads the parsed AST and generates individual tasks (e.g., FetchUserData, ValidateOrder, SendEmail).
Each task contains details such as the tool, retriever, and data required.
Fetching Unit Retrieves Data:
The Fetching Unit identifies tasks that require data fetching (e.g., fetching user data from an API).
It uses the specified retriever to call the API, fetch the data, and return it to the Task Executor.
Task Executor Executes Task:
The Task Executor executes each task once the required data is available.
For example, after fetching user data from the API, the Task Executor validates the order using the retrieved data and sends an email.


b) Functional Flow with Example (AST and DAG)
Scenario:
We will demonstrate the system by executing 20 tasks, some in parallel and some in sequence, using both AST and DAG task structures.

executor = TaskExecutor(task_list)
executor.run()


e) Deployment Architecture
1. Components:
Plan Parser: Deployed as a service that handles various types of input plans (AST, DAG).
Task Producer: Deployed as a scalable service to generate tasks based on the input plan.
Task Executor: Runs in a distributed environment using Kubernetes or serverless functions to handle dynamic task execution.
2. Integration with DynamoDB and Redis:
DynamoDB: Used for task state management, including recording task progress, retries, and results.

Horizontal scaling: Auto-scaling is enabled to handle large numbers of concurrent tasks.
Redis Pods: Manage task queues and ensure tasks are delivered to the correct Task Executors.

Functionality:
The Task Executor integrates with Tools and Retrievers to execute tasks.
Tools define the execution logic for tasks, such as calling an API.
Retrievers gather necessary data before invoking tools.
Diagram Analogy: Represented as the Workflow Framework Components block connected to the Task Producer and Task Executor.
4.6. State Object
Function: The State Object continuously tracks the execution state of tasks. It handles real-time updates on task status (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed), retries, and result streaming.
Real-time Feedback: Provides updates on task execution status and enables dynamic modifications to the task plan based on execution results.
Diagram Analogy: Represented as the State Object block that interacts with the Task Executor & Manager.

5. Execution Flow
The execution flow starts with parsing the input plan and ends with the real-time execution of tasks, including both sequential and parallel execution, with state updates being tracked dynamically.
5.1. Input Plan Parsing
The Plan Parser parses the input plan (Python code or conditional graph) and converts it into an AST or DAG.
5.2. Task Production
The Task Producer processes the parsed plan and generates executable tasks. These tasks are pushed into a queue, ready for the Task Executor to pull and execute.
5.3. Task Execution
The Task Executor pulls tasks from the queue and executes them asynchronously. Tasks may run sequentially or in parallel depending on their dependencies in the Task DAG.
Tools are invoked as part of the task execution, representing external API calls or service invocations.
5.4. Real-Time State Tracking
The State Object continuously tracks each task’s execution state, enabling retries, handling errors, and streaming partial results back to the system.

6. Task DAG Execution Model
The Task DAG defines the flow of task execution, including both sequential and parallel tasks.
Sequential Task Execution:
Tasks such as API_A are executed sequentially. When one task completes, the next task in the sequence is executed.
Parallel Task Execution:
Tasks like API_B and API_C can be executed concurrently if they do not have direct dependencies on each other.
Dynamic Task Management:
The Task Producer can dynamically add, edit, or delete tasks based on real-time feedback from the State Object.

7. Workflow Framework Components: Tools and API Integrations
The Workflow Framework Components include:
Tools: External services or APIs that are invoked during the task execution process.
Example: API_A, API_B, API_C, etc.
Retrievers: Fetch necessary data for executing tasks, which could be retrieved from databases, third-party APIs, or other services.

Overview:
1. Problem Statement:
The current workflow systems, including those integrated with tools like MACAW, face challenges in efficiently scaling task execution dynamically and adapting to evolving workflows generated by LLMs. These systems lack the ability to manage tasks at scale in a modular, real-time, and adaptive manner.
The key challenges are:
Dynamic Task Handling: There is a need for a system that can dynamically parse and execute plans generated by LLMs, while ensuring that only approved components are executed.
Real-Time Execution Tracking: Existing systems struggle with tracking task outputs and reporting statuses in real-time, particularly while tasks are still in progress.
LLM Feedback Loop: Systems do not integrate well with LLM planners to enable iterative task refinement based on execution outcomes.
Modularity and Extensibility: A plugable and modular execution framework is needed to scale and adapt seamlessly without adding internal complexity to existing tools like MMMM.
2. Motivation:
The motivation behind building the Dynamic Executor Agent is to address the need for a scalable, flexible, and modular task execution system that can integrate with and scale out existing frameworks like MMMMM. This agent will:
Scale Task Execution: Provide reliable, dynamic task execution that can handle tasks at scale, with real-time observability and feedback mechanisms.
Dynamic Component Execution: Allow dynamic addition of executable components during runtime, even for workflows generated by LLMs, while ensuring only approved components are executed.
Real-Time Reporting: Track and report execution progress in real-time, enabling transparency and control over ongoing tasks.
Iterative Learning: Enable LLM Planners to learn from ongoing executions and adjust task plans based on real-time feedback.
Modular Design for Extensibility: Ensure the system is modular, extensible, and open to integration with other tools, so that existing systems can leverage it for dynamic and flexible execution.
This agent will enhance task execution scalability across all workflows, including those powered by existing systems like MACAW, ensuring flexible and reliable task execution at scale.
3. Proposal:
We propose building a Dynamic Executor Agent that provides the following key capabilities:
Dynamic Plan Parsing and Execution:
The agent will parse structured plans generated by an LLM, ensuring that only components from the workflow configuration are executed.
The system will support dynamic component addition, allowing new tools or actions to be integrated during runtime, even if they were not part of the original LLM-generated plan.
Real-Time Execution Tracking and Reporting:
State Objects will track task outputs and statuses while execution is ongoing, providing real-time insights into task progress.
An Observer Pattern will be used to report real-time execution steps, tool invocations, and statuses. Each tool will be wrapped with a Decorator Pattern to ensure observability and real-time feedback.
Workflow Framework SDK Integration:
The agent will integrate seamlessly with the Workflows Framework SDK, allowing it to validate and initialize actions from a predefined list of components. This ensures consistency and standardization across all workflows.
The internal complexity of tools will be abstracted from the agent, as the tools will adhere to component interfaces defined in the SDK.
Planner-in-the-Loop Feedback:
The agent will integrate with LLM Planners, allowing them to iteratively adjust task plans based on feedback from ongoing executions. The State Objects will store execution data that the planner can use to refine its strategy in real-time.
This enables a dynamic feedback loop, where task plans can evolve based on the success or failure of previous executions.
Open-Source Modularity and Extensibility:
The agent will follow a LangChain-like modular architecture, decomposing into Plan Parsers, Task Producers, and Task Executors, allowing other teams to extend and reuse these components to build their own agents.
The system will leverage LLMCompiler for real-time, scalable task execution, using its streaming capabilities to manage high-volume tasks distributed across multiple workers.
Integration with Existing Systems (like MMMAACCAAWW):
The agent will integrate with and scale out existing systems like MACAW by providing a reliable, dynamic task execution unit that is modular and plugable. This will ensure that even tightly coupled systems can benefit from flexible, scalable execution.
4. Key Features:
Dynamic Plan Parsing and Component Execution:
Ability to parse structured LLM-generated plans and restrict execution to components listed in the workflow configuration.
Support for dynamically adding executable components during runtime, allowing for flexible and adaptive workflows.
Real-Time Execution Tracking:
State Objects will track action outputs and statuses as tasks are executed, enabling real-time feedback.
The Observer Pattern will report execution progress, and the Decorator Pattern will enhance observability by tracking each tool’s execution steps and output.
LLM Feedback Loop for Adaptive Task Planning:
The agent integrates with LLM Planners to iterate task planning based on real-time execution outcomes, ensuring the workflow evolves based on execution feedback.
State-driven learning allows the planner to adjust task strategies dynamically, enabling more intelligent workflows.
Modular, Reusable Design:
The system is decomposed into modular components: Plan Parsers, Task Producers, and Task Executors. This allows other teams to easily extend or build their own agents using these components.
LLMCompiler’s streaming capability will enable real-time, distributed task execution across multiple workers, providing scalability for large task loads.
Workflow Framework SDK Integration:
Ensures all task actions follow standardized interfaces from the Workflows Framework SDK, simplifying task execution and maintaining consistency.
Tools adhere to the SDK’s interfaces, ensuring the executor can handle tools in a standardized way without internal complexity.
Complementary to APE: Rather than replacing or pointing out shortcomings in APE, the Dynamic Executor Agent is intended to extend its capabilities. This agent will handle tasks that APE might find difficult to scale, providing a seamless interface for executing complex task graphs while keeping APE's secure environment intact.
This proposal outlines a flexible, scalable solution that will extend and integrate with existing systems like MACAW, while providing the flexibility needed to handle dynamic, real-time, and adaptive task execution across complex workflows.

Overview of Dynamic Executor Agent Components
The Dynamic Executor Agent comprises three main components:
Plan Parsing Component: Responsible for breaking down a given plan into manageable tasks. It supports flexibility and modularity to allow for a wide variety of task types.
Task Producer Component: Manages task queues and ensures the system is set up to execute tasks efficiently with retries, timeouts, and parallelism.
Task Executor Component: Executes tasks asynchronously, ensuring parallelism and scalability, while handling task-specific details like retries and timeouts. It produces a detailed JSON result after task execution.
Detailed Architecture: Plan Parsing Component
1. Introduction
The Plan Parsing Component is designed to decompose structured plans into a set of actionable tasks. These tasks can range from tool invocations to data processing and API calls, making the parser highly flexible. This component must be modular to accommodate future extensions and variations in task structures. Additionally, scalability and adaptability are core design principles to ensure the system can handle different plan formats and task types in real-world scenarios.
2.1. Core Functionality
The Plan Parsing Component is built to interpret the input (which could be a plan document, an AST, or a high-level set of instructions) and convert it into task objects. Each task is represented as an independent unit, categorized by its type:
Tool-based tasks (e.g., invoking a tool with input parameters).
Data processing tasks (e.g., file transformation or computation tasks).
API invocation tasks (e.g., making REST API calls or interacting with external services).
Python object tasks (e.g., running Python functions or interacting with Python objects directly).
These task objects can then be serialized and passed to other components for further processing.
2.2. Modular Architecture
The component adopts a modular design to allow flexibility and scalability:
Task Decomposer: Breaks down high-level plans into subtasks. The decomposition can be rule-based, pattern-matching, or AI-driven, allowing flexibility in how tasks are extracted from the input plan.
Task Type Modules: Each task type (Tool Task, Data Processing Task, etc.) has a dedicated parser module. This ensures that new task types can be added easily without disrupting the existing system.
Parser Configuration: The parser can be configured dynamically based on tenant-specific metadata, allowing customization of task parsing logic for different users.
Error Handling: The parser is designed with error handling and fault tolerance. If a certain part of the plan fails to parse, the system logs the error and continues parsing the rest of the plan to avoid cascading failures.
2.3. Extensibility and Adaptability
Modularity: The Plan Parsing Component allows users to extend the system by adding new parsers for custom task types without modifying the core logic.
Configurable Interfaces: Through configuration files, the parser can be adjusted to different plan formats, structures, and use cases, making it adaptable to various tenants or business logic.
Integration with Third-Party Libraries: The component can integrate with existing libraries such as LangGraph or LangChain, enabling compatibility with different frameworks.
2.4. Scalability Considerations
Parallel Parsing: The Plan Parsing Component supports multi-threaded or distributed parsing to handle large plans or complex workflows.
Task Caching: Frequently used tasks or plans can be cached for quicker access, avoiding repeated parsing of the same inputs.
Fault Tolerance: When parsing complex workflows, if a subtask fails to parse, the system logs the failure and continues processing other parts of the plan.
2.5. Task Object Schema
Each task parsed from the plan will conform to a unified schema that includes:
Task ID: A unique identifier for each task.
Task Type: Specifies the type of task (Tool, API, Python Object, etc.).
Input Parameters: Contains the necessary inputs or configurations needed to execute the task.
Dependencies: Describes any inter-task dependencies that might affect execution order.
Execution Metadata: Metadata related to retries, timeouts, and tenant-specific execution rules.
2.6. Example Workflow
A high-level plan is submitted to the system.
The Plan Parser processes the document, identifying sections that correspond to individual tasks.
The decomposed tasks are converted into task objects, which are then serialized and passed to the Task Producer for execution.
2.7. Plan Parsing Flow Diagram
Plan Input: Receives high-level plan structure.
Task Decomposer: Breaks down the plan into discrete task blocks.
Task Type Identification: Identifies whether the task is tool-based, API-based, or a Python object task.
Task Object Creation: Creates task objects for further processing.
Serialized Output: Sends parsed tasks to the next component (Task Producer).

The Dynamic Executor Agent is designed to handle tasks dynamically generated by an LLM Planner, execute them asynchronously, and stream real-time results. The system is optimized using LLMCompiler for better handling of LLM-based task execution, including tasks that return partial results (e.g., tokens) and are adjusted dynamically by the Planner. The architecture focuses on efficient task streaming, synchronization, and Kubernetes-native scalability.
Key Features:
LangChain Runnable Components: Each module (Plan Parser, Task Producer, Task Executor) is built using LangChain’s Runnable framework, enabling modularity and scalability.
LLMCompiler Integration: Optimizes the execution of LLM-based tasks by compiling and streaming tasks more efficiently.
Streaming Output: Tasks stream their output incrementally, sending partial results (e.g., tokens) as soon as they become available, instead of waiting for full completion.
Task Synchronization and Joining: Efficient joining of parallel tasks ensures results are available for downstream processing or feedback to the Planner.
Real-Time Updates: Integration of real-time feedback to the Planner, allowing dynamic modification of the execution plan.
Kubernetes-Native Execution: Designed to scale within Kubernetes pods, reducing the need for external task managers like Celery unless necessary for highly distributed execution.

1. Architecture Components Overview
Stepwise Logical Flow for Parsing Input Plan, Building Task List, and Task DAG Execution
The following logical flow walks through how the raw input plan, which is provided as a string and invokes API tools, gets parsed into a task list, an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), and ultimately gets executed as a Task DAG. The Task Producer takes both the task list and AST as input and generates a Task DAG with parallel and sequential task execution.

Step 1: Raw Input Plan and Tools as String
The input plan is provided as a string. This plan can include a mix of API calls, conditions, and other instructions. Additionally, tools (APIs) to be invoked are also provided as a string representation.
Example Input Plan (as String):
json
Copy code
{
  "plan": "Invoke API A -> Invoke API B (Parallel with API C) -> Invoke API D sequentially",
  "tools": {
    "API_A": {
      "url": "https://example.com/api/a",
      "method": "POST",
      "payload": {"data": "valueA"}
    },
    "API_B": {
      "url": "https://example.com/api/b",
      "method": "GET",
      "params": {"param": "valueB"}
    },
    "API_C": {
      "url": "https://example.com/api/c",
      "method": "POST",
      "payload": {"data": "valueC"}
    },
    "API_D": {
      "url": "https://example.com/api/d",
      "method": "DELETE",
      "params": {"param": "valueD"}
    }
  }
}


Step 2: Parse the Plan into a Task List
The first step is to parse the raw input plan into an intermediate task list, where each task corresponds to invoking an API. The tools (API endpoints and their methods) are extracted as part of this process.
Logical Steps:
Parse Plan: The raw input plan string is parsed into logical tasks.
Extract API Invocations: Identify the tools (API endpoints) to invoke and associate them with tasks.
Example Parsed Task List:
python
Copy code
[
    {"task": "Invoke API A", "tool": "API_A"},
    {"task": "Invoke API B", "tool": "API_B", "parallel_with": "API_C"},
    {"task": "Invoke API C", "tool": "API_C", "parallel_with": "API_B"},
    {"task": "Invoke API D", "tool": "API_D"}
]


Step 3: Parse the Plan into an AST
The input plan is also parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation. This is a hierarchical tree structure that represents the order of execution, including sequential and parallel executions. The AST helps the Task Producer organize the task flow correctly.
Example Logical Steps for Parsing AST:
Sequential Nodes: Each sequential step is represented as a node in the tree.
Parallel Nodes: Parallel tasks (like API B and API C) are represented as children of the same parent node in the tree.
Example AST Representation:
python
Copy code
{
    "type": "sequence",
    "steps": [
        {
            "type": "task",
            "name": "Invoke API A",
            "tool": "API_A"
        },
        {
            "type": "parallel",
            "steps": [
                {"type": "task", "name": "Invoke API B", "tool": "API_B"},
                {"type": "task", "name": "Invoke API C", "tool": "API_C"}
            ]
        },
        {
            "type": "task",
            "name": "Invoke API D",
            "tool": "API_D"
        }
    ]
}


Step 4: Task Producer Takes AST and Task List
The Task Producer now takes the AST and the Task List as inputs. It combines them to form a Task DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), which represents the execution flow of the tasks, including parallel and sequential executions.
Logical Steps:
Parse AST: The Task Producer reads the AST to determine the task execution order (sequential and parallel).
Build Task DAG: Based on the AST, the Task Producer organizes tasks into a DAG. Parallel tasks are grouped, and sequential tasks are chained together.
Handle Dependencies: If there are any dependencies between tasks (e.g., API D depends on API B and C completing), the DAG handles this by representing the task dependencies correctly.

Step 5: Build Task DAG
The Task DAG is the final structure that will be used by the Task Executor to run tasks in parallel and sequential order. The DAG ensures that tasks are executed in the correct order, and it also manages the concurrency for parallel tasks.
Example Task DAG:
plaintext
Copy code
   Invoke API A
         |
  +------v-------+
  |              |
Invoke API B   Invoke API C (parallel)
  +------v-------+
         |
   Invoke API D (sequential after B and C)


Step 6: Parallel and Sequential Task Execution
The Task Executor now takes the Task DAG and executes tasks in the correct order:
Sequential Execution: API A is invoked first.
Parallel Execution: API B and API C are invoked concurrently.
Sequential Execution: API D is invoked only after both API B and API C complete.
Example Execution Flow:
Invoke API A: Sent first in a sequential manner.
Invoke API B and API C: Both are sent concurrently in parallel.
Invoke API D: After API B and API C finish, API D is invoked.

Conclusion
The following steps summarize the entire process:
Input Plan and Tools as String: The input plan and tools (APIs) are provided as strings.
Parse Plan into Task List: The plan is parsed into a logical task list where each task invokes an API.
Parse Plan into AST: The input plan is also parsed into an AST that defines the execution order (parallel and sequential).
Task Producer Takes AST and Task List: The Task Producer combines the AST and Task List to build a Task DAG.
Build Task DAG: The Task DAG represents the execution flow and handles task dependencies.
Task Execution: The Task Executor executes tasks in the correct order, handling parallel and sequential execution.
This architecture ensures that tasks are executed in an efficient and scalable manner, leveraging both parallel and sequential execution models based on the AST and DAG generated by the Task Producer.

        # Join results from multiple parallel tasks
        results = await asyncio.gather(*[task.run() for task in tasks])
        return results

1.5. State Object (Runnable Component)

3. Key Design Considerations
3.1. Streaming Output with LLMCompiler
Using LLMCompiler allows for efficient tokenized streaming of results. This feature enhances LLM-based tasks where partial outputs (e.g., tokens from an LLM) need to be streamed in real-time.
Implementation Example:
python
Copy code
async def run_task(task):
    async for chunk in task.run():
        # Stream tokens using LLMCompiler
        yield await llm_compiler.stream_output(task, chunk)

3.2. Efficient Task Joining
Parallel tasks are joined once all results are available using LangChain’s Runnable interface. The results can be aggregated and passed to the next stage of execution.
Implementation Example:
python
Copy code
async def join_tasks(task_list):
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[task.run() for task in task_list])
    return results  # All tasks finished, join results

3.3. Task Updates and Synchronization
LLMCompiler allows for efficient task re-optimization. The system ensures that tasks can be dynamically updated or canceled while in-flight. LangChain’s Runnable components provide modularity, ensuring updates are efficiently propagated.

4. Technology Stack
LangChain Runnable Components: For modular, scalable execution of the core components (Plan Parser, Task Producer, Task Executor, Planner).
LLMCompiler: For optimizing and streaming LLM-based tasks.
Kubernetes: For container orchestration and task scaling.
Asyncio: For asynchronous, non-blocking execution of tasks.
Redis / Kubernetes Job Queue: For queuing and managing tasks.

5. Recommendation: LLMCompiler Integration
Incorporating LLMCompiler is highly recommended for this architecture because:
Efficient LLM-based Execution: LLMCompiler allows the system to optimize and handle token-based outputs for LLM tasks, providing faster streaming of results and minimizing latency.
Task Compilation: Tasks involving LLM invocations can be optimized for better parallelism and execution efficiency.
Real-time Streaming: LLMCompiler enhances the ability to stream output tokens as they are generated, improving responsiveness in real-time applications.

1. Problem Statement
You are building a Dynamic Executor Agent to address limitations in the sister team’s tightly coupled and obfuscated library. The key issues with using their library include:
Lack of Flexibility and Plugability: Their system is too rigid and doesn’t allow dynamic integration of different tools or external APIs.
Lack of Control: GenAI’s infrastructure needs more control over task retries, timeouts, and scaling. Their library lacks the required flexibility and tenant-specific configurations.
Closed System: Their library is obfuscated and not open-source, preventing contributions and extensions from other teams.
Motivation for Building a Separate Agent:
Internal Open Source: You aim to build an internally open-source agent that provides flexibility, modularity, and transparency for contributions.
Dynamic Execution: The agent needs to dynamically handle different types of tasks, such as API calls, Python object invocations, and more.
GenAI Infrastructure Control: The agent should provide control over timeouts, retries, and scaling, and allow scaling via LLMCompiler’s streaming capabilities.

2. Detailed Design and Architecture
The system is designed with three core modules:
Plan Parsing: Decomposes the plan into task objects.
Task Producer: Produces and manages task queues.
Task Executor: Handles the execution of tasks with built-in retry, timeout, and parallelism features.
The architecture adheres to OOP principles and supports various types of tasks, not just tool-based tasks (e.g., data processing tasks, cleanup tasks, and API tasks). The system will also allow tools dictionary entries to contain Python objects, making the task execution framework highly flexible.

2.1. Architecture Overview
Here’s an overview of the flow and how tasks move through the system, starting with the plan parsing, task production, and execution. Each phase is modularized using LangChain-based components.
Plan Parsing Module: Parses Plan documents into various task types (Tool Tasks, Python Object Tasks, API Tasks).
Task Producer Module: Queues tasks for execution while tracking retry limits, timeouts, and tenant-specific metadata.
Task Executor Module: Executes tasks asynchronously and in parallel, returning a JSON result that includes tool usage and invocation details.

2.2. Extended Architecture with Task Execution Result JSON
The Task Executor will return a detailed result JSON that contains the following:
Invocation Result: A record of which tools were called, how many times they were invoked, and their results (success or failure).
Output from Each Tool: The result of each tool’s execution, along with metadata such as retries and the final outcome.
Result JSON Example:
json
Copy code
{
  "executions": [
    {
      "tool": "APICallTool",
      "invoked_count": 3,
      "results": [
        {"status": "success", "output": "API response data"},
        {"status": "failed", "error": "Timeout"},
        {"status": "success", "output": "API response data"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "tool": "DataProcessingTool",
      "invoked_count": 1,
      "results": [
        {"status": "success", "output": "Processed data"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}


2.3. Task Executor OOP Design
The Task Executor will adhere to OOP principles and support different task types. Example task types could include:
Tool Tasks: Tasks that use external tools, such as API calls or command-line executions.
Data Processing Tasks: Tasks that perform data transformations, cleaning, or enrichment.
Cleanup Tasks: Tasks that clean up temporary data or artifacts after the main task execution is done.
Task Executor Class Design:
python
Copy code
class TaskExecutor:
    def __init__(self, queue, dynamodb):
        self.queue = queue
        self.dynamodb = dynamodb
    
    async def execute_task(self, task):
        try:
            result = await task.run()  # Execute asynchronously
            self.update_task_status(task, "COMPLETED")
            return result
        except TimeoutError:
            self.retry_task(task)
    
    def retry_task(self, task):
        retries = task.get_retries()
        if retries > 0:
            self.queue.enqueue(task)
        else:
            self.update_task_status(task, "FAILED")
    
    def update_task_status(self, task, status):
        self.dynamodb.update_task_status(task.id, status)

OOP Example: Defining New Task Types
You can define different task types by inheriting from a base Task class:
python
Copy code
class Task:
    def run(self):
        raise NotImplementedError

class ToolTask(Task):
    def __init__(self, tool):
        self.tool = tool
    
    async def run(self):
        return await self.tool.invoke()

class DataProcessingTask(Task):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
    
    async def run(self):
        return process_data(self.data)

class CleanupTask(Task):
    async def run(self):
        return clean_up_temp_data()


2.4. Tools Dictionary with Python Object Invocation
The tools dictionary can contain Python objects that can be invoked as part of a task execution. This provides flexibility in dynamically invoking Python functions or methods as part of the task.
Tools Dictionary Example:
python
Copy code
class APICallTool:
    async def invoke(self, url, params):
        # Make an API call and return the result
        response = await httpx.post(url, json=params)
        return response.json()

class DataProcessingTool:
    def invoke(self, data):
        # Process data and return the result
        return {"processed_data": data}

tools = {
    "api_tool": APICallTool(),
    "data_processing_tool": DataProcessingTool()
}

# Usage:
task = ToolTask(tools["api_tool"])
result = await task.run()

This design allows the agent to support dynamically invoking Python objects as part of task execution.

2.5. LangChain Components for Decomposition
The Plan Parser, Task Producer, and Task Executor should be built as modular LangChain components so that other teams can easily build their own agents using these components. This provides a flexible foundation for task execution that can be adapted for different use cases.
Component 1: Plan Parser
python
Copy code
from langchain.core import Parser

class PlanParser(Parser):
    def parse(self, plan_content, format):
        if format == 'json':
            return self.parse_json(plan_content)
        elif format == 'yaml':
            return self.parse_yaml(plan_content)
    
    def parse_json(self, content):
        return json.loads(content)
    
    def parse_yaml(self, content):
        return yaml.safe_load(content)

Component 2: Task Producer
python
Copy code
from langchain.core import TaskProducer

class DynamicTaskProducer(TaskProducer):
    def __init__(self, tools_dict):
        self.tools_dict = tools_dict
    
    def produce_tasks(self, plan):
        tasks = []
        for step in plan["steps"]:
            tool = self.tools_dict.get(step["tool"])
            task = ToolTask(tool)
            tasks.append(task)
        return tasks

Component 3: Task Executor
python
Copy code
from langchain.core import TaskExecutor

class DynamicTaskExecutor(TaskExecutor):
    def __init__(self, task_queue):
        self.task_queue = task_queue
    
    async def execute_tasks(self, tasks):
        results = []
        for task in tasks:
            result = await task.run()
            results.append(result)
        return results

This design follows LangChain’s modular architecture, allowing other teams to reuse or customize each component in their agents.

3. Leveraging LLMCompiler for Streaming and Scaling Tasks
LLMCompiler’s streaming capabilities can be used to scale task execution and handle tasks in real-time as they are generated. By leveraging LLMCompiler, the Task Executor can support:
Streaming Task Generation: As tasks are produced, they can be immediately sent to the Task Executor without waiting for the entire plan to be parsed.
Dynamic Scaling: The streaming capability of LLMCompiler allows tasks to be distributed across multiple workers in real-time, scaling out as the load increases.
Example Workflow with LLMCompiler:
Plan is parsed by the Plan Parser, which streams tasks to the Task Producer.
As tasks are produced, they are immediately sent to the Task Executor, where LLMCompiler manages the scaling of tasks across multiple workers.
Task Execution Flow with Streaming:
plaintext
Copy code
1. Plan is streamed into tasks.
2. Tasks are pushed to the Task Executor.
3. LLMCompiler streams tasks across multiple workers.
4. Each worker processes its tasks asynchronously.

This provides real-time scaling and ensures that tasks are handled as soon as they are produced, without waiting for the full plan to be parsed.

4. Conclusion
In this extended TDD plan, we focused on:
Returning detailed JSON results from the Task Executor, tracking tool invocations, retries, and outputs.
Adhering to OOP principles with flexible task types, including Tool Tasks, Data Processing Tasks, and more.
Enabling the tools dictionary to contain Python objects, allowing dynamic Python object invocation.
Decomposing the Plan Parser, Task Producer, and Task Executor into LangChain components, ensuring easy reuse and customization.
Leveraging LLMCompiler for real-time task streaming and scaling.
By implementing these features, the Dynamic Executor Agent becomes a scalable, flexible, and modular system that provides both control over GenAI infrastructure and an open-source-friendly environment for further contributions.

—-------------------------------------
. Problem Statement:
You are building a Dynamic Executor Agent because the library provided by another team is tightly coupled to their internal architecture, making it difficult to extend or customize for new use cases. Specifically:
Closed Library: The other team’s library is obfuscated and secure, which limits visibility and flexibility.
Lack of Plugability: Their system does not support the seamless integration of new tools, task formats, or external APIs. It is too rigid to accommodate experimentation or dynamically plug in tools.
Lack of Control: GenAI infrastructure, which your team manages, needs more control over scaling, task execution, retries, and timeouts. The sister team's agent doesn't support fine-grained control for handling large-scale infrastructure workloads, especially in a dynamic environment where you need experimentation and flexibility.
Motivation for Building a Separate, Open-Source (Internal) Agent:
Flexibility and Plugability: The new agent should allow for seamless integration of different tools, formats (e.g., Plan documents, DAGs), and APIs. New features should be easy to plug in without affecting the core structure.
Scale-Out and Task Parallelism: GenAI's infrastructure requires massive parallel task execution, which needs to be handled asynchronously and scaled horizontally. The new agent will allow for fine-grained control over scaling, retries, and task timeouts.
Open-Source Friendly: While secure, the agent will have transparent and modular code, making it easier to add features and encourage contributions within the company’s internal open-source ecosystem.
Control Over GenAI Infra: The new agent will provide greater control over the GenAI infrastructure, with built-in support for scaling, high availability (HA), and observability using tools like DynamoDB for state management and OneStream for messaging and scaling.

2. Detailed Design and Architecture
The agent is designed with three key modules:
Plan Parsing Module
Task Producer Module
Task Executor Module
This architecture supports asynchronous execution, scaling, and task retries and allows tenants to control the execution parameters like timeouts and retry mechanisms.

2.1. Architecture Overview
Plan Parsing: The agent parses the Plan document (JSON, YAML, etc.) and converts it into a task execution flow. The plan could describe a sequence of API calls, machine learning model invocations, or external tool integrations.
Task Producer: Based on the parsed plan, the Task Producer creates task definitions and places them into a distributed task queue (e.g., OneStream). Each task has associated metadata such as retry limits, tenant-specific execution parameters, and timeout settings.
Task Executor: The Task Executor is responsible for retrieving tasks from the queue, executing them in parallel, and ensuring fault tolerance through retries. It scales automatically based on the task load and integrates with DynamoDB to maintain the state of each task and ensure consistency across the system.

2.3. Detailed Design of Each Module
Module 1: Plan Parsing
Objective: Parse Plan documents (JSON, YAML, etc.) and convert them into an internal representation that can be processed by the Task Producer.
Key Features:
Plan Format Support: JSON, YAML, XML.
Schema Validation: Ensures that the parsed plan conforms to a valid schema.
Plugin Support: Allows tenants to introduce their custom plan formats or extensions.
Example Workflow:
Plan is parsed and converted into a list of tasks with their dependencies.
Tasks are then handed over to the Task Producer for queueing and execution.
Module 2: Task Producer
Objective: Produce task definitions from the parsed plan and enqueue them in a distributed task queue.
Key Features:
Task Metadata: Includes tenant-specific parameters like timeout, retry limits, and priorities.
Queueing: Pushes tasks into OneStream (internal message queue) for asynchronous processing.
State Tracking: Stores task metadata in DynamoDB for reliable task state management.
Example Workflow:
A set of tasks (e.g., API calls or ML model inferences) is pushed to OneStream.
DynamoDB tracks task status (e.g., PENDING, RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED).
Module 3: Task Executor
Objective: Retrieve tasks from the queue and execute them in parallel while supporting retries, timeouts, and scaling.
Key Features:
Parallel Execution: Task execution is parallelized and asynchronous, supporting thousands of concurrent tasks.
Tenant-Controlled Timeouts and Retries: Each tenant can define how many retries a task gets and its timeout.
Scaling and HA: Integrates with OneStream for scaling and DynamoDB to ensure state persistence.
Error Handling: Automatically retries failed tasks according to tenant-defined rules. Retries are logged and monitored.

2.4. Task Executor Scaling and Retry Mechanism
The Task Executor module is designed to handle large-scale workloads and ensure that tasks are executed efficiently. It integrates with both DynamoDB (for state management) and OneStream (for task distribution and scaling).
Task Parallelism: Tasks are processed in parallel using asynchronous execution (e.g., Python’s asyncio or Celery workers). This allows the system to scale horizontally to handle large task loads.
Retry and Timeout Management: Each task has metadata specifying retry limits and timeouts. If a task fails, it can be automatically retried. If it exceeds the allowed number of retries or timeout, the tenant is notified, and the task is marked as failed.
Scaling: The system dynamically scales up or down based on the number of tasks in the queue. DynamoDB is used to maintain the state and prevent duplicate executions.
High Availability (HA): DynamoDB ensures that task states are maintained, even during failures. OneStream guarantees message delivery, ensuring tasks are not lost in case of failure.

3. Example Classes with Full Extensibility and Modularity
The agent is designed with full modularity and extensibility, allowing developers to easily add new tools, formats, and extensions. The core is based on the LangChain philosophy of building reusable, modular components.
3.1. Example Classes
Class 1: Plan Parser
python
Copy code
class PlanParser:
    def __init__(self, plan_format: str):
        self.plan_format = plan_format
    
    def parse(self, plan_content):
        if self.plan_format == 'json':
            return self.parse_json(plan_content)
        elif self.plan_format == 'yaml':
            return self.parse_yaml(plan_content)
    
    def parse_json(self, content):
        # Convert JSON plan into internal task representation
        pass
    
    def parse_yaml(self, content):
        # Convert YAML plan into internal task representation
        pass

Class 2: Task Producer
python
Copy code
class TaskProducer:
    def __init__(self, task_queue):
        self.task_queue = task_queue
    
    def produce_tasks(self, tasks):
        for task in tasks:
            self.task_queue.enqueue(task)
        # Save task metadata to DynamoDB

Class 3: Task Executor
python
Copy code
class TaskExecutor:
    def __init__(self, queue, dynamodb):
        self.queue = queue
        self.dynamodb = dynamodb
    
    async def execute_task(self, task):
        try:
            await task.run()  # Execute asynchronously
            self.update_task_status(task, "COMPLETED")
        except TimeoutError:
            self.retry_task(task)
    
    def retry_task(self, task):
        retries = task.get_retries()
        if retries > 0:
            self.queue.enqueue(task)
        else:
            self.update_task_status(task, "FAILED")

3.2. Extensibility and Modularity
Modular Tools: New tools can be added to the agent by extending the TaskExecutor class and defining how the tool is executed (e.g., API calls, command-line scripts).
Plugin System: Developers can easily plug in new Plan document formats, tools, or DAG structures by adding parsers, task producers, or execution plugins without modifying the core system.

4. Cross-Library Support with LangGraph, HayStack, and LLAMAIndex
While the agent is built using LangGraph, the SDK is designed to be reused in other frameworks like HayStack and LLAMAIndex to support a wide variety of use cases. The design philosophy emphasizes modularity, making it easy to adapt to different LLM frameworks.
LangGraph: The core agent is built on LangGraph principles, where workflows are designed as modular nodes.
HayStack and LLAMAIndex: By abstracting task execution into pluggable components, the agent can support alternative frameworks by simply swapping out execution layers.

Conclusion
This Dynamic Executor Agent is designed to overcome the rigidity of the sister team's library by offering:
Full plugability: Modular architecture supporting multiple formats and tools.
Parallelism and Scalability: Efficient task parallelism and scaling using asynchronous execution, retries, and tenant control.
Open-source friendliness: Encouraging contributions and extensions while maintaining flexibility and security.
This agent provides full control over the GenAI infrastructure and lays the groundwork for handling large-scale, dynamic task executions in a flexible and extensible way.

Dynamic Distribution Takes Orchestration Agent (Three-Phase Plan)

1. Problem Statement
The Execution Agent is part of a three-agent system (Understanding, Planning, Execution) responsible for executing tasks generated by the Planning Agent. The system must:
Parse structured plans (string or AST).
Schedule and execute tasks in both parallel and sequential workflows.
Manage state tracking and ensure fault tolerance with automatic retries.
Offer the Execution Agent as either a LangChain Component or a SaaS Service.
This document provides a technical breakdown of the system’s architecture, with the implementation divided into three phases.

2. Design and Architecture
Key Components:
State and Session Messages:
The Execution Agent processes state and session messages from the Planning Agent, which provide context for task execution and real-time adjustments.
Plan Parser:
Converts structured plans (in AST format) into executable tasks.
Uses LLMCompiler for optimization, identifying tasks that can be executed in parallel and sequentially based on dependencies.
Task Producer:
Schedules tasks based on the Plan Parser’s output and dependencies using OneStream for task orchestration.
Manages dependencies with a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure to ensure correct task execution.
Task Executor:
Executes tasks using OneStream, ensuring tasks are distributed and executed either in parallel or sequentially as required.
Task Scaling and Parallelism:
The Execution Agent scales task execution, enabling parallelism where tasks are independent to optimize performance and reduce execution time.
Task Restoration and Retry Mechanism:
Failed tasks are restored and retried using DynamoDB for state management, ensuring fault tolerance and persistent tracking of task execution.

3. Example: Planner AST and Task Election DAG

      "depends_on": ["task_1"]
    },
    {
      "task_id": "task_3",
      "type": "parallel",
      "description": "Check Credit Score"
    },
    {
      "task_id": "task_4",
      "type": "parallel",
      "description": "Validate Address"
    },
    {

      "description": "Perform Fraud Check",
      "depends_on": ["task_3", "task_4", "task_5"]
    },
    {
      "task_id": "task_7",
      "type": "sequential",
      "description": "Approve Transaction",
      "depends_on": ["task_6"]
    }
  ]
}

Task Election DAG Example:
text
Copy code
       Task 1
          ↓
        Task 2
        /  |  \
     Task 3 Task 4 Task 5
        \   |   /
         Task 6
          ↓
        Task 7

This structure demonstrates:
Sequential tasks (Task 1, Task 2, Task 6, Task 7).
Parallel tasks (Task 3, Task 4, Task 5) executed concurrently after Task 2 completes.

5. Conclusion
This TDD and three-phase project plan account for the team structure where the lead (you) operates at 50% capacity, focusing on architecture and integration, while two developers work at 100% capacity, focusing on implementation and testing. Over three months, the Execution Agent will be developed, tested, and deployed, with support for both parallel and sequential task execution, fault tolerance, scaling, and integration options (LangChain Component or SaaS Service). The project plan ensures a balanced workload across all phases, delivering the project on time and with high quality.
