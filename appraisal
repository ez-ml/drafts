. Energizing Work and Challenges
"I thrive on complex problem-solving and innovation, particularly within the realm of Generative AI. The process of designing, training, and optimizing AI systems, especially those related to RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) models, invigorates me. I'm driven by challenges that push the boundaries of AI's capabilities, such as improving efficiency and effectiveness in training and inference infrastructure. The dynamic nature of AI research and its application in real-world scenarios is what fuels my purpose, as I see immense potential for transformative impacts across various industries, including finance."

2. Underutilized Skills and Passions
"At CapitalOne, while I am deeply involved in Generative AI projects, I find that my specific interest and expertise in the training and inference infrastructure of AI systems, particularly within the context of RAG models, are not fully utilized. I have a strong foundation in GoLang for microservices development, which I believe can significantly contribute to building robust and scalable AI systems. I am passionate about leveraging this expertise further to enhance our AI capabilities, ensuring they are not only cutting-edge but also efficient and reliable."

3. Career Aspirations in the Next 12-18 Months
"Within the next 12 to 18 months, my goal is to evolve into a Distinguished Engineer role. This position would allow me to lead groundbreaking projects in AI, specifically focusing on the advancement of training and inferencing infrastructure. I aim to spearhead initiatives that refine our AI models, making them more accessible, efficient, and impactful. Achieving this would not only mark a significant milestone in my career but also enable me to contribute more substantially to CapitalOne's technological innovation."

4. Career Aspirations in the Next 3-5 Years
"Looking ahead to the next 3 to 5 years, I aspire to transition into a People Leader role within the AI domain. My vision is to lead a team of talented individuals dedicated to pushing the frontiers of AI, fostering a culture of innovation, collaboration, and continuous learning. I believe that by empowering and mentoring others, we can collectively achieve breakthroughs that redefine what's possible in finance and beyond. My journey towards this goal involves not just technical mastery but also honing leadership and strategic skills to inspire and guide my team effectively."

5. Desired Focus in the Current Role
"In my current role, I want to deepen my involvement in the end-to-end lifecycle of AI model development, especially in the areas of training and inference infrastructure. This includes actively participating in the selection of tools and technologies, like GoLang for microservices, that can enhance our AI systems' efficiency and scalability. I am keen on leading exploratory projects that test new methodologies or technologies, driving innovation from the ground up. Additionally, I'd like to increase my engagement with the broader AI research community to stay at the forefront of emerging trends and best practices, ensuring that CapitalOne remains a leader in AI-driven solutions."
